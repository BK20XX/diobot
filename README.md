# DioBot
A quick Discord bot written by __Dio Brando__ and __GlitchMasta47__

## Setup
1. Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill in the correct information
2. Run `npm install`
3. You're done!

## Running
Run the bot by typing `node bot.js`
> If you would like to open it with ECMAScript 6 support in Node.js versions under v8.0.0, run `node --harmony bot.js`, although you should be updated to v8.0.0 or higher anyways
